# Project ROMA

A project from the WebDev Bootcamp by Supercode(DE) to deepen the knowledge of HTML and CSS with a given design - coded by me.


## What I used

It is completely done in HTML & CSS with flexboxes but no Media Queries, although there is a nice parallax effect.

You can have a look at it here:

### I'm really sorry for this bad readme
It's the first one ever! :D
